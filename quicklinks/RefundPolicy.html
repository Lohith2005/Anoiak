            <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
            <p>Thank you for choosing to work with Anoiak.</p>

            <p>If for any reason, You are not completely satisfied with a service We invite You to review our policy on
                refunds. Please read and make sure you fully understand our refund policy prior to making a payment.
                Anoiak operates as a business, and we expect CLIENTS to understand and respect our policies. Our goal as
                a Design & Development Agency is to bring the highest value per Rupee/Dollar spent by our CLIENTS, and
                in order to help us in that pursuit, we need to cover expenses and fuel our operations. Therefore, we
                require payments to be made on-time in respect to the services offered to CLIENT.</p>

            <p><strong>THIS IS OUR REFUND AND CANCELLATION POLICY, AND BY HIRING ANOIAK FOR SERVICES, YOU ARE BOUND BY
                    THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU AGREE TO ABIDE BY OUR POLICIES.</strong></p>

            <h2>Design & Web Development</h2>

            <p>Design/Web design and development projects require extensive resources, consume our time, and incur
                internal expenses. Therefore, once a payment or deposit is made, it is non-refundable. If a project gets
                canceled, delayed, or postponed by the CLIENT, then all the amount paid will be retained by ANOIAK, and
                if applicable, an additional cost will be charged to the CLIENT for all work completed beyond what was
                already paid for. No exceptions.</p>
            <p><em>Logo Design, Branding, Web Design, UI-UX Design, Search Engine Optimization, Social Media Marketing,
                    & Internet Marketing</em></p>

            <p>Payments for Design, Development, or any of our services are non-refundable even if a fee was paid in
                advance. Once a payment or deposit is made, there are no exceptions to our refund policy.</p>

            <h2>Setup Fees:</h2>

            <p>Setup fees are applied directly to expenses incurred by ANOIAK in the setup phase of any Design,
                Development, or Internet Marketing campaigns and are non-refundable. If any chargeback or payment
                dispute is caused by CLIENT to a bank or credit card company, then CLIENT services and/or projects will
                be suspended, and in some cases, all work will be undone (reversed) without notice. Furthermore, the
                amount of the chargeback fee will be issued to the CLIENT. In Addition, any outstanding balances accrued
                as a result of the chargeback(s) will have to be paid in full before we restore service, deliver any
                files, or commence any work.</p>

            <p class="font-fade"><strong>PLEASE CONTACT US TO ADDRESS ANY BILLING ISSUES, AND WE WILL GLADLY HELP YOU.</strong></p>

            <p class="font-fade">Requesting a chargeback or opening a dispute for a valid charge from us is fraud. Chargebacks are never a
                legal or appropriate means of obtaining a refund. All disputes will be challenged by our lawyers with
                sufficient evidence from our records.</p>

            <h2 class="font-fade">Website Hosting</h2>

            <p class="font-fade">All hosting payments, whether present or past months, are non-refundable. Web hosting accounts are set up
                from the date of your order and are allotted a limited amount of server resources depending on the plan
                you purchased. If CLIENT opens a hosting account but does not use it, payment will still be due. Hosting
                billing cycles continue until a cancellation notice is received in writing from the CLIENT in writing.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-fade">Account Suspension</h2>

            <p class="font-fade">All hosting payments that are 15 days past due will trigger an account suspension. Hosting paid up to 12
                months in advance and canceled before the expiration date will be refunded for the months not yet
                elapsed. ANOIAK reserves the right to disable and/or terminate a userâ€™s account, services, or contract
                if a user is found in violation of our terms and policies. Termination due to policy violations will not
                be refunded.</p>
